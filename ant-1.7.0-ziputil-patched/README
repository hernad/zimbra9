This directory contains an implementation of ZipOutputStream that doesn't
require huge memory footprint for central directory of zip entries.  Central
directory data is written to a temporary file as the zip file is written
and copied to the stream at the end.

The original code is the org.apache.tools.zip.* classes from Apache Ant 1.7.0
release.  The package was renamed to com.zimbra.common.util.zip to avoid
possible namespace collision with Ant classes.

All 11 classes in the package were copied but only ZipOutputStream class has
been modified.

Running ant here will create build/ant-1.7.0-ziputil-patched.jar file.  A copy
of this jar file is checked in under ZimbraCommon/jars.
